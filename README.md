Unfinished game written in 2019 in [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) C++ library. It was developed as an engine, not specific game.

It featured:

### Sprite animation

Normally sprite shows a player, but I had no graphics desginer back then.

### Colission Detection

Was done with the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)
